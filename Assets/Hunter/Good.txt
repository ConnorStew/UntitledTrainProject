As you hand over the coin to the hunter explaining the next stop is for her, she looks up at you with hopeful yet defensive eyes.
Hesitantly, she takes the coin, thanks you, and promises to do her best to make her second chance worth it.
As the doors open the hunter takes a deep breath and steps onto the platform.
The train waits at the platform for a moment as a woman steps on.
Clad in shining armour covered in intricate engravings showing many tales of glory.
The same flowing hair unbound by any helmet, she approaches you.
As she thanks you, and explains the long glorious life she has led. 
As she makes her way deeper into the train she tosses you a coin. 
As the cabin door opens she turns back explaining although it's not the same she owed you a coin. 
Looking down in your palm you see a shining golden coin similar in design to the one you gave but embellished with jewels.
She walks deeper into the train. 
It fills you with pride to see how she has grown and you got a fun trinket too.
