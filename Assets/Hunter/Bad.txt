As you hand over the coin to the hunter explaining the next stop is for her, she seems untrusting but agrees the doors open and she's gone.
The train waits at the platform for a moment and an older woman, scarred, slightly graying hair cut short, and dark sleepless eyes steps onboard and approaches you.
She thanks you for the chance at another life, and while she tells you she did her best, you see a deep sorrow in her eyes. She leaves the carriage youâ€™re in, deeper into the train.
You feel a wave of sadness envelope you.
