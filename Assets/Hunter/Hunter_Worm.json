Ok so i'm just out minding my own business just got payment for the entrails of a <color=yellow>werewolf</color> and… BOOM from outta nowhere this ugly spined leathery beast just pops outta the ground eats <color=yellow>paulius</color> and his house with it. The whole thing musta been a little bigger than this train. Well, I thought that's a <color=yellow>pretty</color> penny even if they don't have enough for the service right now. So long story short i'm stood in the chest of a <color=yellow>cow</color> standing on a pile of three of 'em. Then the crashing of the dirt, chomp, and I'm in the beast. So I started slashing away as fast as I could, just finding organs that looked important. It wasn't long till she stopped moving.",
