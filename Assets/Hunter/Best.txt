You hand the coin over to the hunter explaining the next stop is for her.
She thanks you, and lets you know that evil can not be left alone to rise. She looks at the coin hopefully preparing for the adventure ahead. 
 As the doors open, the hunter takes a deep breath and steps onto the platform.
The train waits at the platform as a short boy with messy brown hair steps aboard.
As he approaches you his eyes appear to be shining gold.
He hands you a small leatherbound book and departs the train.
As you flick through it you see stories and illustrations that depict the life of the hunter, a good life..
You never see the hunter again and feel a great sense of pride.
