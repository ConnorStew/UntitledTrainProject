You hand the coin out to the soldier explaining the next stop is for him. He sits in a quiet contemplation while at the table.
He stands, thanks you for the conversation stating it was sweeter than honey, and pushes the loaf of bread over towards you. He informs you to eat, as it could be a long trip. 

You see a look of determination on his face as he steps out onto the platform, the doors close and onwards the train rolls.

You never see the soldier again but you feel a warmth rush over you.
