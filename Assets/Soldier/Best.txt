You hand the coin out to the soldier explaining the next stop is for him. He sits in a quiet contemplation while at the table.
He stands, pushing the loaf of bread over towards you, 
S: Eat up might be a long trip. Thank you, talking to you been sweeter than honey

As he steps out onto the platform, the doors close and onwards the train rolls.
You never see the soldier again but you feel a warmth rush over you.
