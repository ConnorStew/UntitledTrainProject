The train waits a moment and an older man with a thicker mustache, and a pot belly covered by a highly decorated uniform approaches you. He thanks you for giving him the chance to retreat and informs you that while he saved a majority of his company, he could not save them all.

As he unstraps his gun, leaving it on the table in front of you, he walks off deeper into the train.
You look at the gun with a solemn smile. You helped him and hope he found what he was looking for
