As you hand the coin to the alien explaining that the next stop will be for them, they seem almost unphased by the news.
He informs you he was wondering when I was supposed to get off the train and thanks you for talking, and not thinking that he was a monster.
As the alien makes its way towards the doors you notice the markings they have carved into the table where they once sat, it’s you. You don’t think you’ll be seeing them again and a wave of euphoria washes over you.
