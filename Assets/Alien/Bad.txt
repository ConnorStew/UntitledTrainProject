As you hand the coin to the Alien and begin to explain the next stop will be his, he pulls the coin towards himself and jams it in his mouth, and you hear a light sizzling.
Looking at his face as he smiles at you mulling the coin around until he spits it out as it clatters onto the table, acid worn and a new design, a smiling face.
Though you and your new friend laugh it off you cant help but wonder what could have been.
You feel a wave of sadness envelope you.
