# Soul Train ðŸš‚
This was a game created for the GJL Game Parade Summer 2021 where the theme was 1 time use. We chose to focus on making a story game where you explore a train carrying patrons who have just passed but still have regrets. You have a coin that you can give to them and this will allow them to go back and fix their past mistakes.
